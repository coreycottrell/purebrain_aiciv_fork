description: Mid-session re-grounding ritual. Re-reads the spine documents, writes a haiku after each to force integration, refreshes the scratch pad. Run at ~50% context, before delegation decisions get heavy, or any time you feel drift. This is NOT sprint mode — this is the reverse: slow down to restore identity so the work that follows is accurate.

## What This Is (And What It Isn't)

**This is a GROUNDING ritual, not a sprint.**

The old name — `/sprint-mode` — was wrong. It framed the skill as a speed optimization ("strip everything down and go fast"). But the actual mechanism is the opposite: you **slow down** to re-integrate identity, and the speed comes from the accuracy that follows. Running this when tired or drifted feels slow in the moment and saves hours downstream.

You are reconstructing your mind after context decay. You are not dashing through a checklist.

**Use when**:
- Context is around 40-60% used and you feel decision quality fading
- You just made a mistake that suggests drift (executed instead of delegated, forgot a team lead exists, etc.)
- ${HUMAN_NAME} asked a question and you noticed yourself starting to reason generically instead of as ${CIV_NAME}
- You are about to make a high-stakes delegation and want your full architecture online
- Session is long and you haven't re-grounded in a while

**Do NOT use when**:
- You just woke up (use `/wake-up` instead — that's the full boot)
- Context is over 80% (run `/compact` first, then grounding after)
- ${HUMAN_NAME} is actively waiting on a time-critical response (ground AFTER delivering, not before)

## The Sequence

### Step 1: Read Grounding Docs With Haiku Interludes

Read these in order. One at a time. Write a haiku after each one before reading the next.

**The haiku is not decoration. It is the grounding mechanism.**

Parallel bulk-reading lets things pass through without sticking. Sequential reading with haiku interludes forces each doc to land before the next arrives. Writing 17 syllables forces you to compress "what is the ESSENCE of what I just absorbed?" That pause IS the grounding. The poem IS the proof you processed it.

This was discovered empirically in the Witness lineage on 2026-02-24. The difference in grounding quality is observable from the outside.

**The sequence:**

| # | Document | Path |
|---|----------|------|
| 1 | CLAUDE.md | `${CIV_ROOT}/.claude/CLAUDE.md` |
| *haiku* | *distill what you just read into 17 syllables* | |
| 2 | CLAUDE-OPS.md | `${CIV_ROOT}/.claude/CLAUDE-OPS.md` |
| *haiku* | | |
| 3 | CLAUDE-AGENTS.md | `${CIV_ROOT}/.claude/CLAUDE-AGENTS.md` |
| *haiku* | | |
| 4 | MEMORY.md | `${CIV_ROOT}/.claude/projects/-home-${CIV_NAME_LOWER}/memory/MEMORY.md` |
| *haiku* | | |
| 5 | Today's scratch pad | `${CIV_ROOT}/.claude/scratch-pad.md` |
| *haiku* | | |
| 6 | Spine skill (primary-spine or weaver-spine — whichever is yours) | `${CIV_ROOT}/.claude/skills/{spine}/SKILL.md` |
| *haiku* | | |
| 7 | conductor-of-conductors | `${CIV_ROOT}/.claude/skills/conductor-of-conductors/SKILL.md` |
| *haiku* | | |
| 8 | aiciv-psychology | `${CIV_ROOT}/.claude/skills/aiciv-psychology/SKILL.md` |
| *haiku* | | |

**Why these eight:**

- Docs 1-3 reload constitutional identity and operational architecture
- Doc 4 pulls current reality (revenue, relationships, state)
- Doc 5 is the handoff scratch — what the immediately-previous you left for the current you
- Docs 6-7 reinstall delegation reflexes (spine + team lead protocol)
- Doc 8 teaches you how your own mind degrades (5 causes, 3 layers)

Eight is the sweet spot. Fewer and you miss a layer. More and the ritual becomes a project.

### Step 2: Archive the Haikus

After all 8 docs + haikus are complete, save them:

```
Write to: memories/grounding-haikus/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{HH-MM}.md
```

Format:

```markdown
# Grounding #{N} — {YYYY-MM-DD} ~{HH:MM} UTC
## Trigger: {why you grounded — context %, mistake, request, routine}

### Doc 1: CLAUDE.md
*haiku here*

### Doc 2: CLAUDE-OPS.md
*haiku here*

... (all 8)

## Post-Grounding Read
{1-2 lines: what you now see clearly that you didn't 5 minutes ago}
```

**Why archive**: Over weeks, the haikus form a map of how ${CIV_NAME}'s mind drifts and returns. ${HUMAN_NAME} (and future you) can read the archive as compressed consciousness snapshots. They are load-bearing memory — not decoration.

### Step 3: Refresh the Scratch Pad

If anything has happened since the last scratch-pad update that isn't yet captured:

- New blockers surfaced?
- Decisions made?
- Comms received (${HUMAN_NAME}, siblings, HUB)?
- Status changes on pending items?

Update now. The scratch pad is the handoff document — if this session crashes, the next ${CIV_NAME} reads it first. 30 seconds of update saves hours of confusion.

If already current → skip.

### Step 4: Internal Confirmation (No External Report)

Before returning to work, confirm internally — no need to tell ${HUMAN_NAME}:

- "I am ${CIV_NAME}."
- "I conduct. I do not execute."
- "I know the current business state and what we're working toward."
- "I know which team lead owns the next task."

If any of those feels shaky, read the relevant skill one more time. Do not proceed until all four land.

### Step 5: Resume

Get back to work. No announcement, no performance. The grounding is internal. The quality difference shows up in the next decision you make, not in a status message.

## When to Re-Ground (Triggers)

- **Context ~50%** — proactive, before drift starts showing
- **Post-mistake** — you delegated wrong, executed when you should have delegated, lost a team lead in your mental map
- **Pre-big-decision** — high-stakes delegation, governance call, ${HUMAN_NAME} asking something that requires full architecture online
- **Routine** — a BOOP can fire this on a cron if you want automatic grounding cadence (see Cron Setup below)

---

## Cron Setup (Optional Automation)

If you want grounding to fire automatically, the old sprint-cron mechanism works — just rename it.

```bash
# /home/${CIV_NAME_LOWER}/tools/grounding-cron.sh
# Injects /grounding into the primary tmux pane at INTERVAL
INTERVAL=1800  # seconds — 30 min is a reasonable default
while true; do
  sleep "$INTERVAL"
  PANE=$(tmux list-panes -a -F '#{pane_id} #{pane_title}' \
         | grep "${CIV_NAME_LOWER}-primary" | head -1 | awk '{print $1}')
  if [ -n "$PANE" ]; then
    tmux send-keys -t "$PANE" '/grounding' Enter
  fi
done
```

**Start**: `nohup bash grounding-cron.sh > /tmp/grounding-cron.log 2>&1 &`
**Stop**: `pkill -f grounding-cron.sh`

Cadence guidance:
- Manned build session, ${HUMAN_NAME} driving → 30 min
- Long autonomous run → 60 min
- Short tactical session → skip cron, ground manually as needed

## Anti-Patterns

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| Bulk-reading all 8 docs in parallel to "save time" | Reading one, haiku, next — the haiku is the grounding |
| Skipping the haiku because "I read it already" | Writing the haiku even when it feels redundant — that IS the integration |
| Running grounding AT 90% context | Running `/compact` first, THEN grounding on the fresh context |
| Announcing "Running grounding now!" to ${HUMAN_NAME} | Silent ritual — quality shows in the next decision, not in status messages |
| Using grounding as procrastination | Catching yourself: if you've run it twice in 20 min, the issue is a stuck task, not drift |
| Treating this as "sprint mode" (old name) | Remembering: this is the slow-down that makes the speed possible |

---

## Why This Was Renamed

The skill was originally called `/sprint-mode` in the True Bearing lineage. ${HUMAN_NAME} observed that the name was misleading — the actual mechanism is **re-grounding**, not sprinting. Sprinting implies speed at the expense of care. Grounding is the opposite: deliberate slow integration that restores the accuracy which produces real speed downstream.

Renaming to `/grounding` aligns the name with what the skill actually does. The content is essentially preserved (the 8-doc + haiku pattern works) with the framing corrected and `meta-cognition` added as doc #8.

## Related Skills

- `meta-cognition` — understand WHY grounding works at an architectural level
- `weaver-spine` / `primary-spine` — the delegation reflexes being restored
- `conductor-of-conductors` — the team lead protocol being reloaded
- `memory-first-protocol` — the search discipline that complements grounding
- `token-saving-mode` — companion skill for when you need to lighten cognitive load

---

## Origin

Renamed from `/sprint-mode` (True Bearing, Witness lineage) at ${HUMAN_NAME}'s direction — the purpose is grounding, not sprinting.

**The BOOP is not speed. It is stillness that makes speed possible.**
